# Naturopathy Website
This is a website I am currently building for a Naturopath freelancer, which has a blog connected to a CMS.
## Challenges
I built version 1 of this site using Rebass Component Library and using styled components.
After this first initial MVP, I decided I wanted to use vanilla css and build my own components for greater flexibility and maintainability.
The migration took longer then expected, and at one point in time I had a half state using some pages with Rebass and some without.
The challenge was to make both styles work with each other while I worked on version 2 of the site.
## TODO
-- Agree on 3 Heading sizes with designer to be used through site and update Title component appropriately
-- Write e2e cypress tests

-- Get SVG's to work and replace images in footer (SVG's broke after upgrading gatsby)
-- Create Courses page
-- Create Contact page
-- Update Helmet component
## Technology
-- Gatsby 
-- Netlify
-- Contentful CMS
-- Active Campaign
